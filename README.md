# Project Overview

In this project, we'll predict the future price of Bitcoin.  We'll use historical data on the price of Bitcoin, along with data from Wikipedia about edits to the Bitcoin page.  We'll merge and combine this data, then use it to train a random forest model that will tell us if Bitcoin prices will increase or decrease tomorrow.

We'll develop a backtesting system and use a robust error metric so we can tell if the algorithm is performing well.
